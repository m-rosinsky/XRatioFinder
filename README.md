# X Ratio Finder

A modern dark-mode dashboard for finding and analyzing "ratios" on X (formerly Twitter). A ratio occurs when a reply to a post gets more likes than the original post. When a reply gets 10x more likes than the original post, it's classified as a **BRUTAL RATIO** 💀. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and powered by Bun.
